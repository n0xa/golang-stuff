# GoLang-stuff
A collection of Go tools I make while I learn a little about GoLang.
Mostly Work-In-Progress and tinkering

bgpview.io tools
----------------
* ipasn.go lists BGP Autonomous System Numbers and info about an IP address
* asn.go lists IPv4 and IPv6 Prefixes (subnets) advertised as part of a given ASN

HPFeeds Tools
-------------
* hpfeeds-client.go is a reworked version of a broken, un-maintained HPFeeds implementation in go. I needed an easy way to just get the JSON Payload out of my Honeypot network
